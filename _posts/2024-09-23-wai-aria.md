WAI-ARIA is not directly mentioned in the [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) at all. So, what does it have to do with accessibility?  

## What is WAI-ARIA?

WAI-ARIA stands for "Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications," and is often referred to simply as ARIA. ARIA is written and updated by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/).

ARIA is a set of rules and attributes that allow developers to define more refined semantics for different UI elements. Often, when JavaScript is added to user interactions, extra guidance is needed for screen readers and other accessibility tools. ARIA enables the use of non-semantic HTML, though this doesn't mean developers should aim to write non-semantic HTML. ARIA rules and attributes help accessibility tools convey to users what is happening on the page and what interactions are possible.

## HTML vs. ARIA: Which Should You Use?

When comparing HTML to ARIA, ARIA should always be a last resort. **If there is a semantic HTML element available, use that.** There’s no need for HTML like this: `<div role="navigation">...</div>`. Instead, you should use a native HTML element like `<nav>...</nav>`.

Before using ARIA, check [the native HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) to ensure none apply to your situation. A lot can be achieved with HTML alone.

## How to Use ARIA

As mentioned, ARIA consists of a set of roles and attributes. Let's go over what they are used for.

### Roles

ARIA roles make it possible to describe an element's function in a way that HTML can't. Some HTML elements have default roles. For example, `<input type="radio">` automatically has the role of "radio." Other elements have no role unless one is specifically assigned.

ARIA roles include `tooltip`, `tab`, and `dialog`. They can be divided into six categories: (1) document structure roles, (2) widget roles, (3) landmark roles, (4) live region roles, (5) window roles, and (6) abstract roles. You can find the full list of roles on [MDN's page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles).

Many roles have equivalents in HTML, so there's generally no need to use `role="article"` when you can use the built-in `<article>` element. However, sometimes assigning a role is necessary. For instance, live region roles can signal to screen readers that certain elements require the user’s immediate attention.

That said, it’s crucial to use `role="alert"` only when the user's immediate attention is genuinely required. Misusing it can disrupt the user experience by diverting the screen reader's focus. Just because you, as a developer, think something is urgent doesn’t mean the end user will feel the same way.

### Attributes

ARIA attributes modify an HTML element's state or properties, but these changes apply only to the accessibility tree, not the DOM. For instance, adding `aria-hidden="true"` or `aria-expanded="true"` won’t affect the visual page but will update the accessibility tree. This can hide elements from assistive technologies or indicate that an element controls another element that is currently expanded.

Like roles, attributes are divided into categories: (1) widget attributes, (2) live region attributes, (3) drag-and-drop attributes, and (4) relationship attributes. ARIA attributes follow the format `aria-something`, such as `aria-hidden` or `aria-valuemax`. Different attributes require different value types, including boolean (`true/false`), sets of allowed values, or specific value types like `integer`. The full list of attributes is available on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes).

Some attributes are [global](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes#global_aria_attributes). For example, `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` are global attributes that can be used with any HTML element. Non-global attributes, however, require certain ARIA roles to function properly. For example, `aria-autocomplete` must be used with either `combobox`, `searchbox`, or `textbox`.

## The five rules of ARIA

In addition to roles and attributes, there are also rules to consider when using ARIA. In short, these rules include:

1. Always use semantic HTML instead of ARIA role.

2. Never change native semantics with ARIA roles. 

3. Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-accessible.

4. Do not set `role="presentation"` or `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements.

5. Interactive elements must have an accessible name.

You can find a complete list of rules, with explanations and examples, on W3C's page ["Using ARIA"](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#firstrule). Some exceptions to these rules are also noted there.

I won’t dive into these rules further in this post, as some of them deserve a blog post of their own. Hopefully, more on this topic will come in the future.

## Conclusion

So, should ARIA roles and attributes be ignored? Not entirely. 

ARIA is a powerful tool that can assist users who rely on accessibility technologies to navigate the web. However, ARIA should be used sparingly and only when necessary. Using ARIA roles or attributes without care can do more harm than good.

In fact, a [survey of over one million home pages](https://webaim.org/projects/million/#aria) by WebAIM found that pages using ARIA had, on average, 34% more detected errors than pages without it. As W3C’s [read-me-first guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/read-me-first/) advises: "No ARIA is better than bad ARIA."
